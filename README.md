# Analyzing-Urbanization-of-Countires

The aim of this project is to analyze and plot the Urbanization of countries.

There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country.

The second measure, rate of urbanization, describes the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time.
